Study Summary
This repository contains the analysis for the study titled:
“Impact of Pretreatment Haemoglobin Levels, EBRT Techniques, and Brachytherapy Timing on Chemoradiotherapy Duration among Cervical Cancer Patients at Kenyatta National Hospital (2019–2023).”

Objective
The aim of this study was to explore how modifiable clinical factors—specifically pretreatment haemoglobin levels, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) techniques, and brachytherapy initiation timing—affect the overall treatment duration for cervical cancer patients undergoing definitive chemoradiotherapy.

Analysis Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to assess patient characteristics, identify trends, and detect data quality issues (e.g., duplicates, outliers).

Visualizations included box plots, histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts to illustrate distributions and relationships.

Statistical Tests such as the Mann–Whitney U test and Shapiro–Wilk test were used to assess associations between categorical and continuous variables.

Comparisons were made across:

EBRT methods (2D vs 3DCRT)

Haemoglobin status (<12 g/dL vs ≥12 g/dL)

Brachytherapy timing (during vs after EBRT)

Key Outcomes
The study provides insights into how treatment modality and patient clinical factors may influence the duration of therapy, with potential implications for treatment planning and optimization.
